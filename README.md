Notes:
To Mr. Riverso - We are sincerely sorry for submitting this project this far beyond the due date, and to such a lacking extent. The initial game mechanics feel lost and/or watered down because the supporting visuals and ideas were near-impossible to implement in the given timespan. We're incredibly sorry once again.
