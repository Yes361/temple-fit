OM: Stop! Don't take another step!

MC: Who are you? How did you get here? 

OM: I'm the one who built the temple. I've been here for thousands of years...

MC: How does tha even wo-

OM: I have a duty to protect the city. 

MC: Why haven't I ever heard of you until now?

OM: I only reveal myself to those who reach this final chamber. You are the first in many, many centuries. But heed my warning: the gold you seek is cursed. Do not touch it. 

MC: Cursed? The mayor only spoke of treasures he wanted. I have to retrieve it, or someone else will be sent instead of me. 

OM: The mayor's greed blinds him. Think! Would you rather save the city from a curse, or condemn it for the sake of one man's desire?

MC: I see what you mean but...What am I meant to do now?

OM: Tell the mayor there was nothing here to begin with. The treasures were but a mere prophecy with no actual backing.

MC: But what if he doesn't believe me and executes me?

OM: Then you must find another way. Remember, true courage lies in doing what is right, not what is easy.

MC: I understand. Thank you for the warning.

OM: Go now, and may fortune favour you. The fate of the city rests in your hands.
