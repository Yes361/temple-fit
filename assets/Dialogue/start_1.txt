MC: Where...am I?

Mayor: Ah, you're awake. Good. I trust you're comfortable?

MC: What is this? Why have you kidnapped me?

Mayor: Kidnapped? That's a harsh way to put it. Let's say...invited, shall we? You see, I have a very important task that needs someone who is maybe not as valuable to the city to accomplish. 

MC: And you chose me?

Mayor: Yup! 

MC: What do you want from me...

Mayor: Very direct of you. I guess I'll cut to the chase: I'm sure you know that at the centre of the city lies the Forgotten Temple. I'm sue you've heard the stories of those who enter but never return.

MC: Why is it called the forgotten temple when it's literally at the heart of the city?

Mayor: It sounds dramatic okay!

MC: I guess, but what does all this have to do with me?

Mayor: I need you to go to the temple. There is something in there, something powerful, and I need it. 

MC: What is it?

Mayor: Gold and treasures. Lots of it.

MC: Why would I help you? What do I get in return?

Mayor: You get to live! Come back alive, and you're free to go. Refuse, and...let's say you're living in luxury right now. 

MC: And if I don't come back?

Mayor: You'll join the ranks of the forgotten. But I have faith in you, you have...strength.

MC: Fine, I'll do it. But when I come back, we need to have a serious talk. 

Mayor: Excellent. I wish you luck on your journey then. Go now.
