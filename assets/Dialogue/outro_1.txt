OM: HALT! Do not touch the gold. 

MC: HUH! Who are you? How did you get here? 

OM: I am the Guardian of the Forgotten Temple. I have been here for centuries, bound by the duty to protect this place.

MC: Why do you call it the Forgotten Temple it's literally in the middle of the ci-

OM:Shush. It sounds cool, okay!

MC:Okay…Mr. Guardian...Why haven't I seen you or heard of you until now?

OM: I reveal myself only to those who reach the final chamber. You are the first in many, many years. But heed my warning: the gold you seek is cursed!

MC:Cursed? The mayor said nothing about a curse, just wanting the gold and other treasures...

OM:The mayor knows nothing. He's a stupid idiot. Yeah...a stupid idiot meanie man.

MC: That’s not nice...

OM:I mean, the greed blinds him. Think! Would you rather save your city from a curse, or condemn it for the sake of one man's desire? 

MC:I don't believe you. This is just a trick to keep the gold for yourself. What are you really protecting? 

OM:You dare question me?

MC:Yes. In fact, I don't leave until that gold is mine. 

OM: Then you leave me no choice. If you wish to take the gold, you will have to go through me!
