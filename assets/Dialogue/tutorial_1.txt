Fairy: Hello! What brings you to the forgotten temple?

MC: Why does everyone call it the Forgotten Temple it’s literally in the middle of the ci-

Fairy: It sounds cool okay !!

MC: Sure…What are you doing here? Who are you? 

Fairy: I’m glad you asked! My name is DriftCrystal and I’m the protector of all those who stumble into the temple! Would you like me to show you the exit?

MC: I’m good, thanks. Could you lead me to where the treasures are?

Fairy: The treasures!! Oh no no no no no no…..That’s forbidden!

MC: Uhh right, but my life depends on it, so if you could take me there, that’d be great!

Fairy: I can’t as I’m forever bound to this entrance. However, if you wish, I can teach you the ropes of getting through the temple!

MC: That’d be appreciated. What risks are there anyways?

Fairy: Monsters…Lots of them…

MC: Okay….?

Fairy: Alright, let me explain what you need to do if you want to make it to the top. 

Fairy: Each floor has a scroll piece and key. The scroll pieces combine to form a puzzle word which unlocks the final room, and the key helps unlock the doors to the next floor. 

MC: Okay…which room is the scroll piece and key in?

Fairy: Ah, that information is lost to history. No one knows! You’ll just have to go around rooms and see which rooms have what.

MC: That seems easy enough…

Fairy: Oh! One last thing: there are many ghouls, ghosts, and monsters which roam the temple…If you’re lucky, you’ll miss them. Otherwise, they might challenge you to a battle…

MC: Oh really? 

Fairy: Yes yes…

Fairy: Oooo look to the end of the hall…there’s a monster right now! He seems to be rather tired. Come with me, and we can help fight him!

MC: …Okay…
